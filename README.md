# FlipMart-Global-Sales-Customer-Intelligence-Dashboard
Developed an end-to-end Power BI dashboard to analyze 51,000+ FlipMart sales records, driving growth and operational efficiency. 
I used Power Query to build a robust star schema and DAX to engineer key metrics like Sales Growth Rate, Profit Margin, and Repeat Buyer counts.

The final report features three specialized pages: • Sales Analysis: Tracks $12.6M revenue and $1.47M profit trends. • Customer Intelligence: Segments 17.4K customers to identify top performers. • Product Performance: Evaluates 3,700+ products, highlighting Technology as the most profitable category.
